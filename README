Array2xml: a class to convert a PHP array to XML
It also takes into account attributes and cdata unlike SimpleXML in PHP
It returns the XML in the form of a DOMDocument object for further manipulation
It throws an exception if a tag or attribute name has illegal characters

         - Adapted for Magento along with slight changes to structure and tidying up up of code.
Usage:
  In Magento this class should be installed at /app/code/community/Anny/Array2xml.
  To get a converter (as this is model-based, every instance is distinct),
    $converter = Mage::getModel('array2xml/converter');
  To manually init,
    $converter->init( $version[, $encoding[, $formatOutput]] );
  You can choose to skip init to use defaults. To import xml,
    $converter->setTopNodeName($topNodeName)->importArray($data);
  And to export it, just
    echo $converter;
  To reuse outside of Magento, just remove the 'extends' declaration and the class should run
  independently without issue.
